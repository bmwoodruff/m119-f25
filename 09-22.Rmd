## Introduction

We'll be loading the intensities of bulbs about 2100 hours after they were turned on. 

```{r}
#Use the code below to load the data4led package to your current R session.
library(data4led)

#Use the code below to load the data for all the bulbs at a time near 2100 hours.
dist <- led_time(2100)
head(dist)
```

Note that the actual time is 2104 hours.

## Including Plots


Here is a histogram showing the distribution of intensities of bulbs about 2100 hours after they were turned on. 

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
hist(dist$percent_intensity)
```

Notice how most of the bulbs (all but 1) have an intensity above 100%.  The bulbs got brighter.
