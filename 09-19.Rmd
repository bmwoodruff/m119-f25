## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


## Brain Gains from class earlier.
```{r}
f <- function(x, m=0, b=1){
  m*x + b
}
f(2)

# First function
x <- -4:7
y <- f(x,m=3,b=0)
plot(x,y,type = "l")
```

```{r}
#Second function
x <- -5:5
y <- f(x,m=0,b=-2)
plot(x,y,type = "l")
```

```{r}
#Do we have to specify the variable if we want to replace defaults.
x <- -5:5
y <- f(x,7,-2)
plot(x,y,type = "l")
```

```{r}
#What about order
#Second function
x <- -5:5
y <- f(x,b=-2,m=0)
plot(x,y,type = "l")

```

## Making a scatter plot

We'll use the built in mtcars data set in R to create a scatter plot to compare weight and miles per gallon in the following plot. 

```{r}
#mtcars
#?mtcars

x <- mtcars$wt
y <- mtcars$mpg

plot(x,y)
```

We can see that as weight goes up, miles per gallon drops. 

## Function Practice

Let's practice plotting functions. I'll work on an example using `ifelse`. We'll first define the function.

```{r}
g <- function(x){
  ifelse(x<0 , #condition
         x^2 - 6, #if true
         10 - x) # otherwise
}
```

Now let's compute it at several values.

```{r}
x <- c(7,-7,-33,0)

g(x)
```
It appears to work just fine. I'm going to plot the function as well.

```{r}
x <- seq(-5,5,0.01)
plot(x,g(x), type = "l")
```


Let's swap to another function
```{r}
f <- function(x){
  (2*x + 4)/(x^2)
}

f(-4)
f(1)
f(0)
```
The Inf that appears is not a number.  It didn't return NaN, but rather Inf.  That sounds like something more to learn.
